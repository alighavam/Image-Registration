# Image-Registration
â€¢ Registration of segmented CT scan of spines (L1 to L5) of different patients to an
atlas CT scan (a healthy spine). Non-rigid coherent point drift (CPD) and Iterative closest point (ICP) registration algorithms were applied to the point clouds. Then, an innovative combination of both methods was used to acquire better results. Finally, the
results of the methods were compared using Dice, average surface distance (ASD),
Hausdorff and Jacobian determinant measures.
